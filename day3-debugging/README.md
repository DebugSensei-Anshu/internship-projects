# Day 3 - Introduction to Debugging

This folder contains fixed versions of buggy programs provided in Day 3 of the internship.

## Programs

1. **calculate_average_fixed.py**  
   - Calculates the average of a list of numbers.  
   - Fixes syntax and logical errors from the provided buggy version.

2. **find_largest_fixed.py**  
   - Finds the largest number in a list.  
   - Fixes initialization, assignment, and function name errors.

## Debugging Techniques Used

- Identified syntax errors by running the program and reading error messages.
- Used print statements to verify variable values.
- Applied logical corrections to variable initialization and assignments.

## How to Run

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open each `.py` file in your Python environment (VS Code, PyCharm, IDLE, etc.).
3. Run the script to see the output.

Example (using terminal):

```bash
python calculate_average_fixed.py
python find_largest_fixed.py



The average is 25.0
The largest number is 8
